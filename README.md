# Eevee
A free, offline Pokémon Home alternative for Switch!  

## Features currently available: 
- Bank
- Cloning

## Features planned: 
- ~~Editing~~
- LGPE support

## Origin behind the name: 
I named this program Eevee because of something funny my brother said about Eevee and a Joy-Con.  For more info, go to the funny-stories channel on my Discord server

## Bugs:
- You need to save your files, close the program and reopen for your changes to show.  The UI does not auto-update.  
- DO NOT TRY TO OPEN MORE THAN ONE SAVE AT A TIME!  

## Pro tips: 
- ~~To delete a Pokémon, paste an empty space.~~  
- This program automatically creates the bank at sdmc:/switch/Eevee.bank on the first run.
